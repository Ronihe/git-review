   Git compressed a commit as a set of changes 'delta'

2. git branch

   "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits."

3. git checkout <branch name>
   put you to the branch

4. git checkout -b [yourbranchname]
   if you want to create a new branch AND check it out at the same time

5. git merge:
   A commit with two parents essentially means "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents."
